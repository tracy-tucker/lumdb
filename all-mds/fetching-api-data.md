# Fetching Data from an API

For this project, I used themoviedb.org as an API source.
I just copied the "Example API Request" and used that.

The best time to grab the data is after your component has mounted.
`componentDidMount()`

It's always a good idea to set default state. That way, some data is available when the component mounts.
