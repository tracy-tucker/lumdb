# Leaving create-react-app

How to eject your project from `create-react-app`

**YOU CANNOT GO BACK**
Make a duplicate copy of your code before performing this action.

`npm run eject`

Once completed, your project will have a new folder, `config`.
This folder contains `env`, `jest`, `paths`, `polyfills` and `webpack.config` info.

# Where To Go From Here - Beyond React Basics

Instead of utilizing `create-react-app`, you can use:

Next.js - Great for building actual websites. It has server-side rendering and easier routing.

Gatsby.js - Spits out HTML and CSS to be hosted on a server. It's very fast loading and excellent for static sites.

Meteor - Excellent source for building React Apps and databases.
